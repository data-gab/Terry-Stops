    "In Terry v. Ohio (Links to an external site.), a landmark Supreme Court case in 1967-8, the court found that a police officer was not in violation of the \"unreasonable search and seizure\" clause of the Fourth Amendment, even though he stopped and frisked a couple of suspects only because their behavior was suspicious. Thus was born the notion of \"reasonable suspicion\", according to which an agent of the police may e.g. temporarily detain a person, even in the absence of clearer evidence that would be required for full-blown arrests etc. **Terry Stops are stops made of suspicious drivers.**\n",

Using this data, I was able to predict arrests made after Terry Stops using Binary Classification. This analysis can give the Seattle Police Department and local Seattle government better insight into the demographics of these Terry Stops so that they can better their interactions with citizens of Seattle."

Each row represents a unique stop.Each record contains perceived demographics of the subject, as reported by the officer making the stop and officer demographics as reported to the Seattle Police Department, for employment purposes. Where available, data elements from the associated Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) event (e.g. Call Type, Initial Call Type, Final Call Type) are included.

The data containing continuous values has been normalized using sklearn.preprocessing StandardScaler() package. The data containing categorical values was one hot encoded. Using imblearn.over_sampling SMOTE() function, the imbalanced data was balanced by increasing the minority class. A custom classifier was created with sklearn's BaseEstimator with ClfSwitcher to pass any classifier and parameters for each classifer. This custom classifier was used along with a Pipeline and GridSearchCV. The classifiers used included: KNeighborsClassifier(), RandomForestClassifier(), AdaBoostClassifier(), and GradientBoostingClassifier().\n",
